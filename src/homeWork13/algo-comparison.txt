    Both algorithms have a time complexity of O(n^2) and space complexity of O(1).
    Bubble sort performs more swap operations than the insertion sort. The high number of swaps leads to higher runtime for the bubble sort algorithm.
Although both algorithms have the same complexity, the difference in runtime grows as the number of elements to be sorted increases.
    Conclusion: both algorithms have similar runtime complexities. However, for larger datasets, the bubble sort algorithm becomes slower.
